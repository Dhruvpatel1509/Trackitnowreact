# Trackit (React Version)

I have rebuilt the application using **React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase**.

## Features
- **Modern UI**: Dark mode, glassmorphism, and smooth interactions.
- **Direct Supabase Integration**: No backend server required.
- **Recurring Tasks**: Same logic as before, handled client-side.
- **Analytics**: Interactive charts using Recharts.

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Project Structure
- `src/components/`: React components (Sidebar, Tasks, Analytics).
- `src/lib/supabase.js`: Supabase client configuration.
- `src/App.jsx`: Main application layout.
